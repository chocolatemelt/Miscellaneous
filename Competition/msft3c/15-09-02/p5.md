4-sided figures | 1 point
=========================

Given a 3-tuple of side lengths, it is known that one can form a triangle if the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining side. Given a list of 4-tuples of side lengths, determine if one can form a non-degenerate convex quadrilateral (a strictly four sided figure with no internal angles greater than or equal to 180 degrees).

# Input description/format

The first line contains a positive integer indicating the number (N) of lines to read after the first. Each line after the first contains 4 positive integers separated by single spaces, representing the 4 side lengths.

# Output description/format

The output should contain N lines. Each line should contain either the string "Possible", or "Impossible". The line should say "Possible" if one can form a non-degenerate convex quadrilateral from the 4 given side lengths. Otherwise, it should say "Impossible".
