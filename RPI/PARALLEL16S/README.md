CSCI-4320 Parallel Programming and Computing
=======

### Summary
This holds all my homeworks, projects, and most of the notes from RPI's Parallel Programming course. Feel free to take a look.

P.S. not everything is guaranteed to work perfectly; use at your own discretion (though I've no idea why you would use any of them).
