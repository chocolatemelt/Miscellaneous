THREADS

POSIX threads (Pthreads)
-- standard for multi-threaded model used/supported
    on *nix systems
-- set of APIs
-- gcc -Wall main.c -pthread

Why "thread" term is used?
-- continuous
-- sequence

A single process can be thought of as a "main thread" running with:
-- an address space
-- file descriptors (fd table)
-- instructions to execute (program counter)
-- data to process (stack/heap)
-- etc.

A multi-threaded process has a "main thread" and other
 "threads of execution" that SHARE the encompassing process's
  address space, fds, instructions to execute, data, etc.

Thread-safe
-- code can be called from multiple threads in a single process
    without SYNCHRONIZATION or other problems occurring

Re-entrant functions
-- e.g., strtok(), readdir()


===========================================

C and pthreads

Threads do NOT have:
-- their own file descriptor tables
-- their own address space
