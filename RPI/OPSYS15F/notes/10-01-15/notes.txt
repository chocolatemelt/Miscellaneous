Project 2

-- If while process A is context switching, process B arrives
    and (based on the given algorithm) should preempt process A,
     then process A should complete its context switch, then
      immediately be preempted by process B



pipe() example....

   ....we can send any bytes via the pipe

   double answer = 1.2354;

   write( p[1], &answer, sizeof( double ) );


 bash$ ps -ef | grep goldsd

   this will create two child processes; one is "ps -ef";
    the other is "grep goldsd"

   there's a pipe connecting the two....

   ....such that the output of the ps command is the input to the grep command
